<h1> Final Project Proposal </h1>

<div class="proposal">
<h2> Abstract </h2>
<p> This is going to be an informational site on pugs. You can learn about some of their unique qualities as a pet. As a bonus, I will also introduce my dog, Igor, to everyone. 
</p>

<h2> Description </h2>
<p> For this final assignment, I want to create an informational site for the dog breed, the pug. I have a pug named Igor and I love him more than probably anything in the world. I’ve only been a dog owner for about three years, so I still learn new things about him every day. I want to make an informational site because my first impression on this breed was surprisingly inaccurate, so I want to let people know what they’re really like, from the perspective of someone who has one. Although my opinion is very likely biased, I feel that pugs are a great breed and should be appreciated as so. My target audience is mainly those who love dogs or those who are looking to take care of one, but are unsure of which breed is most fitting for their lifestyles. In addition to information, I also want to dedicate a section to Igor, because he’s great and everyone should see and appreciate him. 
<br>
<br>
The general aesthetic of this assignment will be simple and neutral toned. The color scheme will probably be within the beige family, but that may change as we get closer to the due date. The containers I plan to put the information in will all follow a more rounded sort of aesthetic. I feel that this way, everything is a little more soft. I don’t plan on anything having super hard edges or corners because pugs are especially soft. The vision I have for this website is roughly about three pages: a home page, an informational page about pugs, and a get-to-know-me page for my dog. Throughout the site, I plan on putting a navigation bar on the top in place of a header to allow more space for the information I plan on putting in the body of the page. I also plan on making a favicon out of my dog’s face in Illustrator. I think it’ll be cute because his head is super round. The photos I plan on using for this assignment will all go through Photoshop before being included to make everything a bit more professional looking and cohesive. It has always been a pet peeve of mine when things don’t match up in size or style.
<br>
<br>
The navigation bar on the top will be relatively simple. It will have four sections: Home, What Are Pugs?, Meet Igor, and an Instagram icon that will direct the viewer to the Instagram page my sister and I created for him in a new tab.
<br>
<br>
On the homepage, I’ll be using sections and/or a grid layout to organize the information. The first section will be a brief introduction on the general purpose of the website. It will also give some brief details on how the page is laid out for navigation. Underneath the brief information section will be two boxes that will take the viewer to either the informational page on pugs or Igor’s little fact page. I don’t plan on putting too many pictures on this page, maybe just one or two on the boxes, because the meat and potatoes of this assignment will be on the other pages. 
<br>
<br>
On the informational page about his breed, named “What Are Pugs?” in the navigation bar, I plan on including a diagram on the physical nature of a pug, listing the many unique qualities they have. For example, it’ll contain commonly known qualities like their flat faces, or lesser known qualities like their weirdly silky ears. The list won’t be extremely exhaustive, it’ll just be the ones that are worth noting. I hope to make this section a little more interactive to keep viewers engaged, but that is also up for change. For the second half of the page, I plan on having two sections again, but this time it will inform the viewer of the pros and cons of this breed. For this section specifically, I will temporarily not be biased, so rest assured that the information displayed on this page will be accurate. I’ll be organizing this information using a list format, probably accompanied with positive and negative icons like checks and X’s in order to make it a more visually comprehensive and appealing element. I will also leave a link or two to websites that offer more information on that topic. There will be a small section after these lists on my personal opinions on having a pug as a pet (Disclaimer: it’s biased. I love pugs. We should all love pugs.) After going through this page, I would hope that the viewer feels they’ve learned a decent amount of information on pugs in general. For prospective dog owners, I would hope that this information helped narrow down their options to make a decision. 
<br>
<br>
For Igor’s page, named “Meet Igor”, I want to include more media because I’ve compiled an extremely large amount of photos and videos of him growing up over the years. The style of this page will be reminiscent of a blog or a social media profile, like a Facebook page. I plan on having a small profile for him in a sticky box on one of the sides, with the rest of images and photos displayed vertically in the body, as a means for us to scroll through some of his most stand out qualities. Facts will be peppered in, and if a piece of media has a story behind it, I will briefly explain the story and/or context. 
<br>
<br>
Lastly, once the viewer reaches the end of the fun facts, they’ll be greeted by a little game that I made for Igor. It’s a playable maze game that I created using Processing, featuring Igor as the playable character. The goal of the game is to guide him through the maze to the bone. It utilizes the arrow keys only, so it’s a very, very simple game. I wanted to close the page off on a fun note, so I thought a game would be great for that purpose.
